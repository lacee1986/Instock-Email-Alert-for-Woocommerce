Handy plugin to create an input field if the product is out of stock. The user will be alerted with a custom email, when the product stock changed.

== Description ==

This plugin creates an input field on the single product page, if the product is out of stock under the summary. The user can enter an email address to subscribe for the product alert. 
This email address is saved to the database within a new table. If the product stock changed from out of stock, the user will get an email with a custom message. This message can be edited on the option page.

* Custom Email Sender / Subject / Email address
* Custom Email Message with tags (%product_name%, %product_link%)
* Custom Placeholder & Submit button value for the form
* Custom Error / Success message
* Disable default CSS
* Use shortcode instead of the default form
* List of subscribers with filters

You must use the Woocommerce single template file to display the form.

In this case, you should install a plugin to handle the emails. I recommend the "WP Better Emails" plugin.
